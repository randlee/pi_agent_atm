# Swarm Operations Runbook

Practical workflow for launching, monitoring, throttling, recovering, and handing off large Pi agent swarms.

This runbook is operator guidance. It does not replace Beads as the work ledger, Agent Mail as the reservation/message ledger, `pi doctor` as the live diagnostic surface, or the release evidence gates as claim authority.

## Source Of Truth

| Surface | Authority | Command or artifact |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Work ownership | Beads issue state and comments | `br ready --json`, `br show <id>`, `br update <id> --claim --actor "$AGENT_NAME"` |
| Cross-agent coordination | Agent Mail messages, reservations, and build slots | MCP Agent Mail `macro_start_session`, `file_reservation_paths`, `fetch_inbox` |
| Live swarm readiness | Doctor swarm diagnostics | `pi doctor --only swarm --format json` |
| Cargo/RCH admission | Cargo headroom preflight | `scripts/cargo_headroom.sh --runner rch --admit-only check --all-targets` |
| Remote build status | RCH queue and worker state | `rch status`, `rch queue`, `rch doctor` |
| Handoff bundle | Operator runpack | `python3 scripts/build_swarm_operator_runpack.py --capture-current ...` |
| Saturation and timeline evidence | Redacted swarm activity ledger | `docs/swarm-activity-ledger.md`, schema `pi.swarm.activity_digest.v1` |
| Deterministic replay evidence | Swarm flight recorder | `docs/swarm-flight-recorder.md`, schema `pi.swarm.flight_recorder.report.v1` |
| Offline replay policy comparison | Swarm replay operator workflow | `docs/swarm-replay-operator-workflow.md`, `pi swarm-replay-preview --trace <trace.json>` |

## Startup Checklist

Run these before claiming work in a multi-agent session:

```bash
export AGENT_NAME="${AGENT_NAME:-$(whoami)}"
export PI_CARGO_AGENT_SUFFIX="$AGENT_NAME"
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="/data/tmp/pi_agent_rust_cargo/${AGENT_NAME}/target"
export TMPDIR="/data/tmp/pi_agent_rust_cargo/${AGENT_NAME}/tmp"
mkdir -p "$CARGO_TARGET_DIR" "$TMPDIR"

git status --short --branch
br ready --json
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan
pi doctor --only swarm --format json > /data/tmp/pi_swarm_runpack/doctor.json
scripts/cargo_headroom.sh --runner rch --admit-only check --all-targets \
  --decision-json /data/tmp/pi_swarm_runpack/cargo-admission.json
rch status
rch queue
```

Green startup means:

- `git status --short --branch` has no uncommitted work from this agent.
- `br ready --json` has a real open issue, not a tombstone or deleted item.
- `pi doctor --only swarm --format json` has no red finding that says new swarm work must stop.
- `scripts/cargo_headroom.sh --runner rch --admit-only ...` returns `admit` or `allow`.
- `rch queue` does not show saturated or stale heavy builds that would make more cargo work irresponsible.

If any check is degraded, keep the raw command output and choose the response from the recovery table below. Do not convert degraded coordination or RCH state into a vague "tests failed" note.

## Claim A Bead

Use `bv` for prioritization and `br` for the actual claim:

```bash
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan
br ready --json
br show <issue-id>
br update <issue-id> --claim --actor "$AGENT_NAME"
br comments add <issue-id> --author "$AGENT_NAME" --message \
  "Claimed by $AGENT_NAME. Scope: <files/modules>. Validation: <commands>. Coordination: <Agent Mail status>."
```

Before editing, reserve the narrowest practical file set in Agent Mail:

```text
file_reservation_paths(
  project_key="/data/projects/pi_agent_rust",
  agent_name="$AGENT_NAME",
  paths=["src/module.rs", "tests/module_tests.rs"],
  ttl_seconds=3600,
  exclusive=true,
  reason="<issue-id>"
)
```

If Agent Mail writes fail because the MCP database is unavailable or corrupt, record the failure in the Beads comment and continue with the Beads claim as the soft lock. Do not wait in coordination-only loops when useful non-overlapping work is available.

## Cargo And Test Policy

CPU-heavy Rust commands must go through RCH:

```bash
env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR" TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" \
  rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets

env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR" TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" \
  rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR" TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" \
  rch exec -- cargo test <focused-filter> -- --nocapture
```

Use local commands only for non-heavy checks:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
git diff --check
timeout 60s ubs --staged --only=rust .
python3 scripts/check_ubs_staged_delta.py
./scripts/reconcile_beads_ledger.sh
```

If `timeout 60s ubs --staged --only=rust .` times out or is dominated by whole-file baseline noise, run `python3 scripts/check_ubs_staged_delta.py`. The delta gate is acceptable only when it reports no warning or critical finding on staged changed lines. Keep the raw timeout or baseline-noise summary in the handoff.

## Remote Validation Proof Ledger

Remote validation proof is governed by
`docs/contracts/remote-validation-proof-ledger-contract.json` with ledger schema
`pi.remote_validation.proof_ledger.v1`. The ledger is operator evidence only;
it is not release performance evidence, benchmark support, strict drop-in
certification evidence, or a replacement for RCH, `cargo_headroom.sh`, CI, UBS,
Beads, Agent Mail, or claim-integrity gates.

Each proof entry must identify the command, command class, runner requirement,
resolved runner, RCH worker/job, remote/local fallback state, start/end
timestamps, exit status, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `TMPDIR`, remote target/tmp paths,
artifact retrieval status, warnings, and the final evidence classification.

Interpretation rules:

- `clean_remote_proof=true` requires an RCH remote run, successful command exit,
  no local fallback, and clean or non-applicable artifact retrieval.
- `local_fallback=observed` is never remote proof.
- `local_fallback=refused` is a correct fail-closed blocker for RCH-required
  gates, not a pass.
- Queue backoff must be recorded as a blocked proof entry rather than converted
  into a skipped green gate.
- Artifact retrieval warnings must stay visible in handoff. A remote command can
  exit 0 while artifact retrieval is degraded; that is not clean remote proof.

When the proof ledger is embedded in an operator runpack, inspect these fields
before closing any RCH-required bead:

```bash
jq '.remote_validation_proof_ledger.summary' runpack.json
jq '.remote_validation_proof_ledger.entries[] | {
  command: .command.rendered,
  class: .command_class,
  resolved: .runner.resolved_runner,
  remote: .runner.remote_execution,
  local_fallback: .runner.local_fallback,
  artifacts: .artifact_retrieval.status,
  clean: .evidence_classification.clean_remote_proof,
  status: .evidence_classification.status,
  warnings: [.warnings[].warning_id]
}' runpack.json
```

Golden examples live in
`tests/golden_corpus/remote_validation_proof_ledger/examples.json` and cover a
clean remote pass, local-fallback refusal, queue backoff, and artifact retrieval
warning.

## Monitor An Active Swarm

Use this status loop while work is in progress:

```bash
git status --short --branch
br list --status=in_progress --json
br ready --json
rch status
rch queue
pi doctor --only swarm --format json
```

Watch for:

- Multiple agents editing the same file without Agent Mail reservations or Beads comments.
- `br list --status=in_progress --json` entries with old `updated_at` timestamps and no recent comments.
- `rch queue` entries with stale progress, repeated artifact retrieval failures, or slot pressure.
- `pi doctor --only swarm --format json` findings for Agent Mail build slots, reservation conflicts, cgroup memory pressure, target/TMPDIR headroom, or RCH classifier failures.
- Dirty worktree entries outside your claimed file set.

Do not revert unrelated dirty files. Treat them as another agent's work unless the owning bead or the user explicitly says otherwise.

## Throttle Or Pause

Back off new claims when any of these are true:

| Signal | Command | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| RCH admission denies or backs off | `scripts/cargo_headroom.sh --runner rch --admit-only check --all-targets` | Stop starting heavy cargo jobs. Continue docs, source inspection, or small non-cargo fixes. |
| Queue pressure is high | `rch queue` | Wait for active jobs to finish before launching more cargo. |
| Agent Mail reservations conflict | `pi doctor --only swarm --format json` or Agent Mail reservation response | Narrow the file set, choose a different bead, or coordinate with the holder. |
| Beads has stale in-progress work | `br list --status=in_progress --json` | Comment on the stale issue, verify no recent owner activity, then reopen only if it is clearly abandoned. |
| Drop-in or release evidence is stale | `scripts/report_swarm_claim_readiness.py` | Do not make release-facing claims. File or work the evidence gap. |
| Worktree is dirty outside your scope | `git status --short --branch` | Ignore unrelated changes and keep your commit narrowly staged. |

## Stalled Bead Recovery

Use this only for clearly abandoned work:

```bash
br show <issue-id>
br comments list <issue-id>
git log --oneline --decorate --all -- <claimed-file>
br update <issue-id> --status open --assignee "" --actor "$AGENT_NAME"
br comments add <issue-id> --author "$AGENT_NAME" --message \
  "Reopened as stale: no recent owner activity found; no file changes reverted."
```

Do not reopen an in-progress bead just because Agent Mail is degraded. A current Beads comment, recent commit, or active file reservation is enough evidence that another agent may still own it.

## Recovery Drills

### Agent Mail Degraded

1. Run `pi doctor --only swarm --format json` and save the finding.
2. Try the MCP registration/read path: `macro_start_session` or
   `register_agent`, then `fetch_inbox` or `list_agents`. Keep the exact
   health error, for example `database schema missing required tables`.
3. Try the narrow reservation write once with `file_reservation_paths`. If
   writes fail because Mail is red, read-only, or schema-corrupt, do not require
   Agent Mail reservations before coding.
4. Use Beads as the coordination record:

   ```bash
   br show <issue-id> --json
   br update <issue-id> --status in_progress --assignee "$AGENT_NAME"
   ```

5. Keep work on a narrow file set and mention the degraded Mail state in the
   final handoff.
6. Close out through Beads and git:

   ```bash
   br close <issue-id> --reason "Completed with Agent Mail unavailable; Beads used as soft lock"
   br sync --flush-only
   git add .beads/ <changed-files>
   git commit -m "<summary>"
   git push origin main
   ```

Final handoff wording should include: `Agent Mail unavailable: <exact error>;
Beads assignee/status used as soft lock; reservations/messages were not trusted
for this bead.`

### RCH Retrieval Or Disk Pressure

1. Run `rch status` and `rch queue`.
2. Run `scripts/cargo_headroom.sh --runner rch --admit-only check --all-targets`.
3. If the classifier points at local target/TMPDIR headroom, move `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and `TMPDIR` under `/data/tmp/pi_agent_rust_cargo/$AGENT_NAME`.
4. If the remote command failed, treat it as a code or remote-build failure only after the raw RCH output identifies that class.

### Dirty Worktree

1. Run `git status --short --branch`.
2. Stage only files for the current bead.
3. Do not use `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git checkout --`, or `rm` cleanup commands.
4. If unrelated dirty files block a command, record the exact blocker and ask for direction.

### Saturated Review Loop

1. Build or read the swarm activity digest described in `docs/swarm-activity-ledger.md`.
2. If saturation reasons show duplicate work, stale introductions, repeated blockers, or low validation throughput, stop launching broad review agents.
3. Pick one narrow implementation bead, a focused `testing-*` skill, or a concrete follow-up bead from the digest recommendation.

## Handoff Bundle

Capture a handoff bundle before ending a swarm shift:

```bash
capture_dir="/data/tmp/pi_swarm_runpack/${AGENT_NAME}-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$capture_dir"

python3 scripts/build_swarm_operator_runpack.py \
  --capture-current \
  --capture-dir "$capture_dir" \
  --project-root /data/projects/pi_agent_rust \
  --agent-name "$AGENT_NAME" \
  --out-json "$capture_dir/operator-runpack.json" \
  --out-md "$capture_dir/operator-runpack.md" \
  --out-autopilot-input-pack-json "$capture_dir/autopilot-input-pack.json" \
  --out-autopilot-plan-json "$capture_dir/autopilot-plan.json"
```

The runpack schema is governed by `docs/contracts/swarm-operator-runpack-contract.json`. The runpack is a redacted index over existing evidence, not a release performance claim and not a replacement for the source artifacts.
The autopilot input pack schema is governed by `docs/contracts/swarm-autopilot-input-pack-contract.json`. It normalizes source statuses for the dry-run planner, but it is still advisory and never replaces Doctor, Beads, Agent Mail, RCH, git, or the source artifacts themselves.
The autopilot plan schema is governed by `docs/contracts/swarm-autopilot-plan-contract.json`. It maps the input pack to ordered dry-run actions such as `claim_ready_bead`, `wait_for_rch`, `adjust_swarm_budget`, `use_beads_soft_lock`, `reopen_stale_bead_candidate`, `run_docs_only_work`, `capture_handoff`, or `stop_and_surface_blocker`.
When the command emits the companion input pack and plan, the runpack also includes `autopilot_handoff` with schema `pi.swarm.autopilot_handoff.v1`. That section names the input-pack and plan schemas, artifact paths, selected advisory action, and source provenance so a new agent can inspect one handoff bundle without treating the runpack as a new source of truth.
The plan also includes `work_partitions` for ready Beads. Those entries recommend reservation globs, likely collision surfaces to avoid, alternate file families, confidence, and degraded caveats. They are diagnostic only; operators still claim through Beads and reserve through Agent Mail when it is healthy.
The input pack and plan also carry `budget_drift` evidence with schema `pi.swarm.budget_drift.v1`. It compares the last accepted swarm resource preflight profile with live cgroup, memory, scratch-path, RCH queue, and active-owner observations. Status `stable` keeps the current ceiling, `degraded` recommends reduced fanout with hysteresis, and `deny_new_work` recommends admitting no new agents or heavyweight RCH verification until the live signals recover.
The plan also includes `failure_actions` for common operational blockers. Those entries use stable catalog IDs for RCH artifact retrieval, local Cargo target/TMPDIR pressure, remote compiler failures, Agent Mail schema/read-only degradation, Beads JSONL drift, stale Beads ownership, and unknown operational failures. Unknown entries fail closed with a redacted raw excerpt and safe inspection commands instead of guessing a root cause.
The no-mock autopilot E2E harness emits `pi.swarm.autopilot_e2e.v1` plus `pi.swarm.autopilot_e2e.event.v1` JSONL events. It uses temp Beads and temp git workspaces where safe, fixture-captured degraded Agent Mail and RCH inputs where live mutation would be unsafe, and verifies healthy claim, empty queue, Beads soft-lock fallback, saturated RCH, stale bead review, unrelated dirty worktree, and malformed-source fail-closed scenarios. This is operator admission evidence only; it is not a release speed, drop-in, or benchmark claim.
The final closeout gate emits `pi.swarm.autopilot_decision_gate.v1`, governed by `docs/contracts/swarm-autopilot-decision-gate-contract.json`. It compares the shipped input pack, planner, work partitions, failure-action catalog, budget drift watcher, E2E/logging evidence, runpack handoff, safety guards, pushed commits, and quality gates to the prompt-to-artifact checklist. A failed gate emits `follow_up_beads` and `decision=file_follow_up_beads_before_closing_epic`; a passing gate is still only closeout evidence over Beads, git, RCH, Doctor, Agent Mail, and source artifacts, not a new source of truth.
The context-intelligence closeout gate emits `pi.context_intelligence.closeout_gate.v1`, governed by `docs/contracts/context-intelligence-closeout-gate-contract.json`. It maps each `bd-ircr3` child bead to code, tests, docs or evidence, commands, close reasons, and commit hashes; then it checks graph contracts, graph builder, freshness and claim gates, bundle planner, redaction and invalidation, preview surface, prompt injection, no-mock E2E, performance budgets, Doctor/runpack posture, operator docs, README freshness, pushed commits, staged UBS, and Beads ledger reconciliation. A passing context gate is closeout evidence only and does not replace Beads, git, RCH, Doctor, runpacks, or source files.
The validation-broker closeout gate emits `pi.validation_broker.closeout_gate.v1`, governed by `docs/contracts/validation-broker-closeout-gate-contract.json`. It maps each `bd-gusp4` implementation child bead to code, tests, docs or evidence, commands, close reasons, and commit hashes; then it checks source-boundary contracts, lease storage, source normalization, admission policy, CLI lease flow, fault corpus, Doctor/runpack projection, no-mock E2E coverage, stress-budget evidence, operator docs, README freshness, pushed commits, staged UBS, and Beads ledger reconciliation. A passing validation-broker gate is closeout evidence only and does not replace Beads, git, RCH, Doctor, runpacks, Agent Mail, CI, UBS, `cargo_headroom.sh`, or source files.

### Validation Broker Operator Workflow

The validation broker is an advisory coordination aid for expensive validation
work. It helps agents decide whether to run a gate now, wait for an active slot,
reuse equivalent evidence, narrow the command, or recover stale slots. It does
not claim beads, reserve files, schedule RCH jobs, waive CI, or turn stale data
into a green validation result.
In short: it does not claim beads, does not replace RCH, and does not skip
required gates.

Use the broker only after the normal ownership checks are visible:

1. Check Beads for actionable work and stale ownership with `br ready --json`,
   `br show <id> --json`, and `br list --status=in_progress --json`.
2. Reserve files through Agent Mail when the Mail DB is healthy. If Mail is
   red, read-only, or schema-corrupt, use the Beads assignee as the soft lock
   and record the Mail blocker in the bead or handoff.
3. Run `pi doctor --only swarm --format json` and
   `scripts/cargo_headroom.sh --admit-only ...` before heavyweight gates so
   scratch-space, cgroup, CPU, memory, and RCH posture remain explicit.
4. Ask the broker for a plan before launching duplicate or broad validation
   commands. Treat the result as advice, not permission to skip required gates.

Typical read-only status capture:

```bash
pi validation-broker status \
  --store "$PI_VALIDATION_BROKER_STORE" \
  --format json \
  --out-json "$capture_dir/validation-broker-status.json"
```

Typical plan request:

```bash
pi validation-broker plan \
  --request "$capture_dir/validation-request.json" \
  --inputs "$capture_dir/validation-inputs.json" \
  --store "$PI_VALIDATION_BROKER_STORE" \
  --policy "$capture_dir/validation-policy.json" \
  --format json \
  --out-json "$capture_dir/validation-broker-plan.json"
```

Interpret decisions conservatively:

| Decision | Operator action |
| --- | --- |
| `allow` | Run the requested gate through the declared runner and still record the actual command result. |
| `wait` | Do not launch a duplicate heavyweight gate; wait for the active owner or ask for an update. |
| `coalesce` | Reuse only the named artifacts whose command, git head, target/TMPDIR, runner, feature flags, and hashes match the request. |
| `narrow` | Replace the broad command with the broker's narrower required action, then validate that narrower scope honestly. |
| `deny_local_fallback` | Do not let an RCH-required command fail open into a local build. Surface the RCH or headroom blocker. |
| `stale_recover` | Mark the stale slot visibly, open a non-overlapping slot or rerun after provenance mismatch, and do not kill processes. |
| `degraded_block` | Stop and surface the missing, stale, malformed, or unavailable source rows. |

Acquire, renew, and release mutate only the append-only slot store:

```bash
pi validation-broker acquire \
  --request "$capture_dir/validation-request.json" \
  --store "$PI_VALIDATION_BROKER_STORE" \
  --started-at "$started_at_utc" \
  --expires-at "$expires_at_utc"

pi validation-broker renew \
  --store "$PI_VALIDATION_BROKER_STORE" \
  --slot-id "$slot_id" \
  --owner "$AGENT_NAME" \
  --heartbeat-at "$heartbeat_at_utc" \
  --expires-at "$expires_at_utc"

pi validation-broker release \
  --store "$PI_VALIDATION_BROKER_STORE" \
  --slot-id "$slot_id" \
  --owner "$AGENT_NAME" \
  --at "$released_at_utc" \
  --reason "gate completed and artifacts recorded"
```

The broker's reusable-evidence path is fail-closed. Reuse is valid only when
the broker names the slot and its provenance matches the current request. A
similar command from another git head, target directory, TMPDIR, runner,
feature set, dirty-path scope, or artifact hash is a rejected reusable slot, not
a pass.

Privacy and redaction boundaries:

- Broker status, plan, runpack, and autopilot summaries should carry schema IDs,
  source availability, source hashes, degraded reasons, and bounded excerpts
  instead of raw prompt bodies, mailbox tokens, command logs, or secrets.
- Dynamic paths, PIDs, ports, timestamps, durations, long numeric IDs, and hex
  IDs should be normalized before blocker fingerprints are compared across
  agents.
- Agent Mail health and reservation facts are coordination evidence only. If
  Mail is unavailable, do not infer that nobody owns a file; fall back to Beads
  and visible handoff notes.
- Synthetic stress artifacts such as
  `docs/evidence/validation-broker-stress-budgets.json` are engineering budget
  evidence only. They are not release performance evidence and do not support
  README speed, capacity, or strict drop-in claims.

Validation broker troubleshooting:

| Symptom | Operator response |
| --- | --- |
| Agent Mail schema-corrupt, red, or read-only | Use Beads assignee and visible handoff notes as the soft lock; do not infer absent reservations and do not wait in coordination purgatory. |
| RCH-required gate would fail open locally | Treat `deny_local_fallback` as a hard blocker, surface the RCH status or queue evidence, and rerun only when remote execution is available. |
| Scratch-space, target-dir, or TMPDIR headroom is low | Run the documented cargo headroom preflight, switch to an isolated high-capacity target/TMPDIR pair when allowed, and do not launch broad gates until headroom is explicit. |
| Slot store is missing, malformed, or unavailable | Treat the broker posture as degraded, avoid coalescing evidence, and record the malformed source path or missing artifact in the handoff. |
| Reusable artifact provenance does not match | Reject reuse and run the required gate for the current command, git head, runner, features, target directory, TMPDIR, and artifact hash. |

These commands remain mandatory before commit when code changed, even when a
broker plan says `allow` or `coalesce`:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
git diff --check
rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets
rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
ubs --staged --only=rust .
./scripts/reconcile_beads_ledger.sh
```

When closing the autopilot epic, collect the actual command outcomes and pass them to the final gate:

```bash
final_gate_dir="/data/tmp/pi_swarm_autopilot_final_gate/${AGENT_NAME:-agent}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
mkdir -p "$final_gate_dir"

## Completion Checklist

Before closing a bead:

```bash
env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR" TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" \
  rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets
env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR" TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" \
  rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
git diff --check
git add <changed-files> .beads/issues.jsonl

For docs-only changes, use docs-focused validation instead of forcing cargo:

```bash
command -v git br bv rch cargo jq python3
python3 scripts/build_swarm_operator_runpack.py --self-test
e2e_dir="/data/tmp/pi_swarm_autopilot_e2e/${AGENT_NAME:-agent}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"

## Validation Record

When this runbook changes, run at least:

```bash
command -v git br bv rch cargo jq python3
python3 scripts/build_swarm_operator_runpack.py --self-test
e2e_dir="/data/tmp/pi_swarm_autopilot_e2e/${AGENT_NAME:-agent}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
python3 scripts/build_swarm_operator_runpack.py \
  --run-autopilot-e2e \
  --capture-dir "$e2e_dir" \
  --out-autopilot-e2e-json "$e2e_dir/summary.json" \
  --out-autopilot-e2e-events-jsonl "$e2e_dir/events.jsonl"
python3 -m json.tool docs/contracts/swarm-operator-runpack-contract.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool docs/contracts/swarm-autopilot-input-pack-contract.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool docs/contracts/swarm-autopilot-plan-contract.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool docs/contracts/swarm-autopilot-decision-gate-contract.json >/dev/null
cargo fmt --check
git diff --check
./scripts/reconcile_beads_ledger.sh
```

If a validation command is unavailable or degraded, record the command, exit code, and stderr in the Beads closeout instead of claiming the runbook is fully validated.
